Inspired from [Mathologerâ€™s video about Times Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8) and [Michael's DONG video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXUUClgd-Eo).

Number of Points and Multiplication factor play a key role in this code. The idea is to place equidistant points on the perimeter and connecting/drawing a line between two points with respect to the multiplication factor. The afore mentioned [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8) explains this in detail. This simple analogy creates beautiful math patterns, shown below.

By increasing the number of points from 1 to 100 and setting the multiplication factor to a nnumber, the following patterns are observed.

Multiplier = 2

Multiplier = 3

By increasing the multiplication factor and setting the points to a constant:

[Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1847-mathologer-modulo-circle/#N=99&M=2&color=angle) have done a better animation.

This project has been a great practice for Python and has also been a good example for visualizing a simple math problem.
